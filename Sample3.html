			<h2>The Culture of the English Department at Virginia Tech</i></h2>
			<p>For my class ENGL 3834 Intercultural Professional Writing, I selected the local site of Virginia Tech for rhetorical analysis. I was required to analyze a local culture and representations of the culture in three media artifacts. The goal was to show the impact of representations on understandings of culture. 
I chose to write about the culture of the English department at Virginia Tech because it is a culture I identify with. Since Virginia Tech is largely a school of engineering, it was interesting to critique the implications of being a Liberal Arts and Human Sciences major inside of it. My three media artifacts, an English Club flyer, an ad in Philologia (Undergraduate Research Journal for Liberal Arts and Human Sciences), a featured story in Feast of Words 2010 (the Department of English Magazine), were selected at random around campus in order to expose true representations of the English major. Through this assignment I learned the harm of poor communication and contexts of unequal power and privilege.
