			<h2>A Book Review of <br><i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></h2>
			<p>In ENGL 4824 Science Writing, I was required to read Rebecca Sklootâ€™s book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The nonfiction account tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman whose cells were mass-produced without her permission for scientific exploration. My writing sample from this class is a book review on the story that sheds light on the science while engaging the reader. Along with providing a basic summary, I was required to zero in on a topic related to the book in order to start a new conversation aside the review. 
I zeroed in on the science topic of telomeres because they connect to the idea of immortality. The book review opens with a quote from one of the family members that shows the confusion of the idea and of the workings of the human body. I opened by quoting a member of the family because family life was a central focus in the novel. My review discusses the appeal of the novel to an audience who may not have read it, but it also explains a science phenomenon inside the body to an audience who may not know that a telomere tail is like a ticking clock.
