			<h2>The Submissive Female in "Rude," the Hit Single</i></h2>
			<p>I explored the different meanings of feminism and the implementation of feminist ideals in interaction design in ENGL 4874, my capstone experience. One assignment for the class instructed students to find an interaction design of our choosing that spoke to feminist ideals. We were to include a description of the design and analyze its usability. For this assignment, I chose to comment on the hit single “Rude,” by Magic! because of its popularity in current pop culture. I was able to organize my information so that many concepts built off of one another. Although I think the song is catchy, my voice was kept objective throughout. I provided evidence for my claims by referencing the song lyrics and researching proposal rituals and feminist theory. My visual presentation of the material did not distract the reader from the content.</p>
